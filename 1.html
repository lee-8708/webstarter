<p><strong>I</strong> don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
There is just one thing I need<br>
I don't care about the presents<br>
Underneath the Christmas tree</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> just want you for my own<br>
More than you could ever know<br>
Make my wish come true<br>
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> don't want a lot for Christmas<br>
There is just one thing I need<br>
And I don't care about the presents<br>
Underneath the Christmas tree</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> don't need to hang my stocking<br>
There upon the fireplace<br>
Santa Claus won't make me happy<br>
With a toy on Christmas Day</p>
<p><strong>I</strong> just want you for my own<br>
More than you could ever know<br>
Make my wish come true<br>
<p style="margin-top:10px;"><strong><u>All I want for Christmas is you</u></strong><br>
<p style="margin-top:10px;">You, baby</p>
